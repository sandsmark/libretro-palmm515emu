Emulator wrapper:
add 320*320 frame buffer silkscreen, 2xBRZ should be able to make 320*320 version of the 160*160 silkscreen
Tango icons don't grow enough with a big window

CPU:
sysTrapPceNativeCall, ARM Emulator
CPU32 table lookup opcodes
RAM wait states

CPU I/O:
Timer capture events, I don't think there possible though with the Palms hardware
Peripheral Control Register, audio ppm mixing selection and timer cascade mode
All edge triggered interrupts(currently always level triggered)
Port G SPI stuff
Setting the battery dead bit(PDDATA 0x80) if the emulated battery percent gets too low(don't know how low this is)
DRAMC write enable
All of DRAMMC
pen input
Port M Infrared shutdown (PMDATA 0x20)
interrupt control register (ICR), POL5 and edge trigger selects
ADC7846 temperature sensors
ADC7846 dock sensor
some undocumented I/O might be on port e and port j
if a timer triggers more than once per CLK32 it will lose any triggers after the first and get out of sync
SPI1, probably the sdcard since sdcards use SPI for data transfer
SPITEST SSTATUS is undocumented and therefore unemulated

Debug tools:
missing icons

Memory:
Sdcard can't be read or written to
Sdcard can't be inserted or removed
Sdcard has no error handling in save/load state
storage RAM protect(likely already done from fixing chip select bits)
USB chip address range

SED1376:
swivelview register

Other:
Had to modify musashi because the damn NDK isn't C compatible, m68kcpu.h, line 565


Fixed:
timers shouldn't allow comp bits to be cleared until read with a 1 in them and should remain in interrupt state until they are cleared(the interrupt state part is unverified)
SED1376 byte and word swap bits
qt play pause icon not working for emu control button
SED1376 register access
SED1376 picture in picture registers
PCTLR, can divide CPU speed by 1<->31
Palm OS usage of the "rte" instruction is incompatible with the 68020, switch to 68000 core
System Control Register, 0xXXFFF000 all upper banks are registers mode
Port D keyboard enable register
(HW verified)PDPOL inverts interrupts by inverting PDDATA bits, the data register is affected by PDPOL
Endian safe savestates
PLL Control Register, Wake Select
(Resolved by MC68VZ328UM_CORRECTIONS datasheet, its 0xA28, 16 bits)The data sheet says LRRA is 0xFFFFFA29 and 0xFFFFFA28 but its only 8 bits?
(All except edge triggered INT0/1/2/3 restart PLL)Check if interrupts restart PLL when its disabled
Disabling PLL also turns off general purpose timer 1 and 2 unless they are set to use CLK32 as there source
All chip select registers
The boot memory mapping where ROM starts at 0x00000000 and RAM is swapped in
Bits 15 and 14 of the chip selects, currently only the upper 16 bits are taken into account
Supervisor only chip select bits
RAM location and size setting, Dragonball VZ can set the page mapping SDCTRL(SDCTRL only sets external physical pins not RAM mapping)
