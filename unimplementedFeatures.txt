Timer capture events, I don't think there possible though with the Palms hardware
SED1376 register access
storage RAM protect
sysTrapPceNativeCall, ARM Emulator
cpu32 table lookup opcodes
Check if interrupts restart PLL when its disabled
Peripheral Control Register, audio ppm mixing selection
Port D edge sensitive interrupts(currently always level sensitive), currently always triggers an interrupt when a button is pressed
The data sheet says LRRA is 0xFFFFFA29 and 0xFFFFFA28 but its only 8 bits?
The boot memory mapping where ROM starts at 0x00000000 and RAM is swapped in
(debug tools)missing icons
Port G SPI stuff
RAM location and size setting, Dragonball VZ can set the page mapping SDCTRL
DRAMC write enable
All of DRAMMC
All chip select registers
Setting the battery dead bit(PDDATA 0x80) if the emulated battery percent gets too low
Sdcard can't be read or written to
Sdcard can't be inserted or removed
Sdcard has no error handling in save/load state
Port M Infrared shutdown (PMDATA 0x20)
Disabling PLL also turns off all timers except the realtime clock unless they are set to use clk32 as there source

Fixed:
System Control Register, 0xXXFFF000 all upper banks are registers mode
Port D keyboard enable register
(HW verified)PDPOL inverts interrupts by inverting PDDATA bits, the data register is affected by PDPOL
Endian safe savestates
PLL Control Register, Wake Select
