# To anyone worried this is piracy

These ROMs are no different than iOS ipsws, 3DS ctrtransfer, PS3UPDAT.PUP or any other closed source device firmwares.  
Its a free OS coming on a paid device!

In any sane country this is also covered under "right to repair" legislation since the device cant run without the OS.
