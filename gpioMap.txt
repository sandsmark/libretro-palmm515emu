General Layout:
Port A: Fixed 0x40, likely nothing attached, is used by the Dragonball VZ built in grayscale display controller on other models
Port B: Fixed 0x3F, likely nothing attached, probably used for chip select
Port C: Usually 0x7F or 0x3F(less common), needs to be investigated further
Port D: Hardware buttons
Port E: Always 0x5E or 0x5C, only bit 1 seems used, needs to be investigated further
Port F: Always 0x9D or 0x9C, only bit 0 seems used, needs to be investigated further
Port G: 0x15 when backlight is off, 0x17 when its on, bit 1 is a read back of SED1376 GPIO 0 pin 4
Port J: Fixed 0xB0, needs to be investigated further
Port K: Fixed 0x04 in testing, used to select Port Ds active matrix line, bit 4 enables the vibrator motor
Port M: Fixed 0x23, needs to be investigated further
