------------------------------------------
v0.9.5 to v0.9.8(Oct 18 2018 - ??? ?? 2018)

RetroArch GUI:
*switch to official VFS API, no more blobs of fopen() calls
*update the core info file

Qt GUI:
*fixed audio threading
*removed unneeded buffers on the GUI side and replaced them with a mutex

Core:
*sound works perfectly as far as I can tell(unless a program purposely sets the sample length > 1 second, which is useless for generating sound anyway)
*add ARM optimized 68k CPU core(not fully working yet, SIGSEGVs when running)
*allow safety checks to be disabled with EMU_NO_SAFETY, accuracy is maintained when its not defined
*switch byte buffer orders to optimize for 16 bit opcode fetches

------------------------------------------
