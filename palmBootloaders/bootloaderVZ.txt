Bootloader says it starts at 0xFFFFFE00 but there is no data(only 0x00) until 0xFFFFFF00.(first 0x100 bytes maybe protected?)

The data at 0xFFFFFF00 pertains only to initializing UART 1 and 2 and trying to copy data and boot over UART.

Bootloader accesses 16 bit WATCHDOG register as 8 bit at 0xFFFFFFC0.(may be a way to force reset if no data is transferred after 3 seconds)

The data sheet says that the bootloader instruction buffer is 32 bytes but its actually 64, a sensible mistake because 64 bytes is 32 normal length 68k instructions.

To enter the bootloader EMUBRK must be held down and a reset performed, this seems impossible for a consumer palm but may be possible by configuring the i/o port as an output, setting that bit to 1 then resetting.

The reset vectors for bootloader mode are unknown but likely 0xFFFFFF00 for stack pointer(stack grows downward) and program counter.

The data from 0xFFFFFFC0 to 0xFFFFFFE4 was put there by Sony/Palm and is not part of the stock bootloader.
