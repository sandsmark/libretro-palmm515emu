Timer capture events, I don't think there possible though with the Palms hardware
SED1376 register access
sysTrapPceNativeCall, ARM Emulator
cpu32 table lookup opcodes
Peripheral Control Register, audio ppm mixing selection
All edge triggered interrupts(currently always level triggered)
(debug tools)missing icons
Port G SPI stuff
DRAMC write enable
All of DRAMMC
Setting the battery dead bit(PDDATA 0x80) if the emulated battery percent gets too low
Sdcard can't be read or written to
Sdcard can't be inserted or removed
Sdcard has no error handling in save/load state
Port M Infrared shutdown (PMDATA 0x20)
interrupt control register (ICR), POL5 and edge trigger selects
storage RAM protect(likely already done from fixing chip select bits)

Fixed:
System Control Register, 0xXXFFF000 all upper banks are registers mode
Port D keyboard enable register
(HW verified)PDPOL inverts interrupts by inverting PDDATA bits, the data register is affected by PDPOL
Endian safe savestates
PLL Control Register, Wake Select
(Resolved by MC68VZ328UM_CORRECTIONS datasheet, its 0xA28, 16 bits)The data sheet says LRRA is 0xFFFFFA29 and 0xFFFFFA28 but its only 8 bits?
(All except edge triggered INT0/1/2/3 restart PLL)Check if interrupts restart PLL when its disabled
Disabling PLL also turns off general purpose timer 1 and 2 unless they are set to use CLK32 as there source
All chip select registers
The boot memory mapping where ROM starts at 0x00000000 and RAM is swapped in
Bits 15 and 14 of the chip selects, currently only the upper 16 bits are taken into account
Supervisor only chip select bits
RAM location and size setting, Dragonball VZ can set the page mapping SDCTRL(SDCTRL only sets external physical pins not RAM mapping)
