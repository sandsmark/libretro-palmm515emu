This is like unimplementedHardware.txt but only lists things that have functionality issues not accuracy issues.

Sound(those cute little PWM beeps)
Nothing can be installed(theres no memory card, hotsync emulation or direct installation hack)
When running OS commands through callFunction() it can crash
Only runs in debug mode because the touchscreen can only be pushed with a jump to OS function hack
Holding the buttons emulates pressing them like a turbo button(may be caused by the lack of sound emulation, a sound plays on app switch and may block the CPU while waiting for the button to release)
Screenshots use window size and that makes them blurry from filtering

Fixed:
Screen scales wrong when paused
Memory is only 8mb(expected since only 1/2 the chipselect lines are emulated properly)
RTC doesnt seem to work
The touchscreen pixels do not correspond to the device pixels in the QT version
