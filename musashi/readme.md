# Customized Musashi(68k emulator) for Palm m515 emulator

Due to some incompatibilitys with my main target platform Android, I am making a custom fork of Musashi, I also changed it to use fixed width in types.  

Features over default Musashi:  
Fixed incompatiblity with Androids "typedef uint unsigned int;" in system headers  
Mame stuff removed  
Uses fixed width int types

If you are looking for an accurate 68k emulator that has the most compatiblity, use this one.
