HwrDoze locks up when running at 100%, the cause is currently unknown.

This fixes it but inaccurate, so it has something to do with PCTLR
//power control burst mode
/*
if(pctlr & 0x80)
   newCpuSpeed *= (pctlr & 0x1F) / 31.0;
*/

Need to wake the CPU from PCTLR even if the interrupt is masked:
Power Control Enableâ€”This bit controls the operation of the power control module. While this bit is low, the CPU clock is on continu- ously. When this bit is high, the pulse-width comparator presents the clock to the CPU in bursts or disables it. When this bit is high, a masked interrupt can disable the power control module.
