Emulator wrapper:
add 320*320 frame buffer silkscreen, 2xBRZ should be able to make 320*320 version of the 160*160 silkscreen
Tango icons don't grow enough with a big window

CPU:
sysTrapPceNativeCall, ARM Emulator
CPU32 table lookup opcodes
RAM wait states
Trace T1 bit, should be unused by the OS and applications anyway

CPU I/O:
Timer capture events, I don't think there possible though with the Palms hardware
Peripheral Control Register, audio ppm mixing selection and timer cascade mode
All edge triggered interrupts(currently always level triggered)
Port G SPI stuff
Setting the battery dead bit(PDDATA 0x80) if the emulated battery percent gets too low(don't know how low this is)
DRAMC write enable
All of DRAMMC
pen input
Port M Infrared shutdown (PMDATA 0x20)
interrupt control register (ICR), POL5 and edge trigger selects
ADC7846 temperature sensors
ADC7846 dock sensor
some undocumented I/O might be on port e and port j
if a timer triggers more than once per CLK32 it will lose any triggers after the first and get out of sync
SPI1, probably the sdcard since sdcards use SPI for data transfer
SPITEST SSTATUS is undocumented and therefore unemulated
may need to trigger an interrupt if a IMR masked interrupt becomes unmasked and its bit is still set in IPR
When SPICLK2, SPITXD or SPIRXD on port e is disabled ADS7846 functions should respond appropriately(not transmitting or receiving or blocking both for the clock)
port g data bit 2 may need to be 0 to access ADS7846
REFREQ clock frequency in RTCCTL should slow down the RTC when enabled
port d IRQ* bits edge triggered interrupt mode is not emulated
port g backlight state readback
edgeTriggeredInterruptLastValue may need to be locked when PLL is off
port d data register seems to have its data bits cleared when an edge triggered interrupt is cleared(according to MC68VZ328UM.pdf Page 10-15)

Debug tools:
missing icons

Memory:
Sdcard can't be read or written to
Sdcard can't be inserted or removed
Sdcard has no error handling in save/load state
storage RAM protect(likely already done from fixing chip select bits)
USB chip address range

SED1376:
swivelview register


Fixed:
port b pin 6 is xored with the power detection on the alarm/power LED, if docked it turns the LED off, if not docked it turns the LED on
touch interrupt seems to not use IRQ5(it does, theres a test for it now)
port d seems to allow using special function pins as inputs while active unlike other ports, this needs to be verified(verified by MC68VZ328UM.pdf Page 10-15)
CPU_RUN_MODE is not preserved on save state and could allow executing after an address error if a save and load are performed(CPU_RUN_MODE is not used when address error is disabled)
Bootloader memory access
need to check REFREQ clock frequency in RTCCTL
PLLCR CLKEN being off should also disable the SED1376 but this would require a bank refresh on writing to PLLCR
proper clearing of timer interrupts
PCTLR should not divide palmCrystalCycles or dmaclksPerClk32 can't use it(removed palmCrystalCycles from dmaclksPerClk32)
if PCTLR divides the PLL it may also affect DMACLK, SYSCLK and the timers(it doesnt)
timers shouldn't allow comp bits to be cleared until read with a 1 in them and should remain in interrupt state until they are cleared(the interrupt state part is unverified)
SED1376 byte and word swap bits
qt play pause icon not working for emu control button
SED1376 register access
SED1376 picture in picture registers
PCTLR, can divide CPU speed by 1<->31
Palm OS usage of the "rte" instruction is incompatible with the 68020, switch to 68000 core
System Control Register, 0xXXFFF000 all upper banks are registers mode
Port D keyboard enable register
(HW verified)PDPOL inverts interrupts by inverting PDDATA bits, the data register is affected by PDPOL
Endian safe savestates
PLL Control Register, Wake Select
(Resolved by MC68VZ328UM_CORRECTIONS datasheet, its 0xA28, 16 bits)The data sheet says LRRA is 0xFFFFFA29 and 0xFFFFFA28 but its only 8 bits?
(All except edge triggered INT0/1/2/3 restart PLL)Check if interrupts restart PLL when its disabled
Disabling PLL also turns off general purpose timer 1 and 2 unless they are set to use CLK32 as there source
All chip select registers
The boot memory mapping where ROM starts at 0x00000000 and RAM is swapped in
Bits 15 and 14 of the chip selects, currently only the upper 16 bits are taken into account
Supervisor only chip select bits
RAM location and size setting, Dragonball VZ can set the page mapping SDCTRL(SDCTRL only sets external physical pins not RAM mapping)
